# ngramgenerator
A simple command line utility that reads in strings from standard input and produces a list of all the ngrams contained in the input. 
An ngram is a length-n sequence of characters, sometimes used for language modeling or other kinds of text analysis. 
My program prints all of the ngrams in a given string; see the examples below for details.
The ngram program reads from standard input, which we can send to the program using the shell | operator.
